# CodeClause_Movie_Recommendation_System

Gone are the days of flipping through local TV guides or renting physical copies of movies. In today's digital age, the majority of the world's movie libraries are available online through streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. These platforms have evolved to not only provide access to an extensive library of films but also to assist users in the challenging task of choosing what to watch next.

Overall, the movie recommendation system has revolutionized the way we consume movies. It has made it easier and more convenient for users to find new movies to watch and has also helped to promote lesser-known films that may have gone unnoticed.
